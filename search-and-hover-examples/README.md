## fusiontips - search and hover examples

These two examples should work once you plug in your own Fusion Tables API key which you can obtain [here](https://code.google.com/apis/console)

Upload the fusiontips.js file to the same folder where the HTML file is located.

To make this work with your own Fusion Table map, change the info in lines 35 to 45 to reflect your specifications, including your Fusion Table encrypted ID. If you're not sure what your geometry column is, look at your map and see what it says after "Map of.." (i.e. "Map of geometry", "Map of lat")
